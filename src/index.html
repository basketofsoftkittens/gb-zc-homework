  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <p>The game is played by drawing cards one at a time. Each card can either be played on one or more of the pin piles (on the left) or one of the two ball piles (on the right). Click on a pile to play the current card there. The possible moves are highlighted. Cards must be played in order of rank on the pin piles. The pins are ordered bottom-to-top, left-to-right. If a card cannot be played on a pin pile, it must be played on a ball pile.</p>
  <p>When the third card is played on a ball pile, the ball is thrown and a score is calculated based on the number of nonempty pin piles. If all of the pins are filled before filling the first ball pile, a strike is scored. If all of the pins are filled after filling the first ball pile but before filling the second ball pile, a spare is scored. When both balls have been thrown, the game is over.</p>
